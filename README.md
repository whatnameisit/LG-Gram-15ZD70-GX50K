# LG-Gram-15ZD970-GX50K
macOS Catalina Beta 2

  I have not had much to test and currently do not have the laptop.
  
  It's mostly for testing things with Github.
  
## Things that I know are working
  1. Proper graphics acceleration with HDMI output and working sound and input
  2. USB configuration
  3. Working Battery status
  4. iMessage and Facetime will work if SMBIOS is updated (RMNE set as en0)
  5. Touchpad with ApplePS2SmartTouchpad.kext because PrefPane not displayed with VoodooPS2Controller.kext
## Things you might want to test
  1. NVRAM and PS2/EC debugging to save keyboard backlight level
  2. Replacement of WiFi & BT Module
  3. SD Card Reader
